README: How to Run the T3 Stack Application Locally
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

T3 Stack: Make sure you have the T3 stack installed. You can follow the installation guide on the T3 documentation.
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the Node.js official website.
npm: npm comes bundled with Node.js. You can verify the installation by running:
bash
Copy code
npm -v
SQLite: Ensure SQLite is installed on your system. You can download it from the SQLite official website.
Prisma CLI: Make sure Prisma CLI is installed. You can install it globally with the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g prisma

Steps to Run the App Locally

Clone the Repository
Open your terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username and your-repository with your GitHub username and the name of the repository.
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies by running:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up the Database

Create a .env file in the root directory if it doesn't already exist.
Add your database URL in the .env file. It should look like this:
env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
Run the following command to apply the migrations and set up the database:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma migrate dev
This command will create the necessary database tables and seed your database if you've set up any seed files.
Run the Development Server

## Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up the following environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

(Steps to Create a .env File
Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt:

Navigate to your project directory where your code resides.
Create the .env File:

You can create the file using a text editor or directly from the command line.
Using a Text Editor:

Open your favorite text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.).
Create a new file and save it as .env in the root of your project directory. Make sure to include the dot (.) at the beginning of the filename.
Using the Command Line:

In your terminal, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
touch .env
If you're using Windows and the touch command is not recognized, you can use:
bash
Copy code
echo. > .env
Alternatively, you can create the file using a command like this (in PowerShell):
powershell
Copy code
New-Item -Path .env -ItemType File
Edit the .env File:

Open the .env file you just created in your text editor.
Add your environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE. For example:
plaintext
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=file:./db.sqlite
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth_client_secret_here
Save the File:

After adding the necessary variables, save the .env file.).

```plaintext

After the database is set up, you can start the development server by running:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command will start the application, and you should see output indicating the server is running.
Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
You should see your application running.
Optional: Run Prisma Studio

To manage your database visually, you can run Prisma Studio by executing:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma studio
This will open a new tab in your browser where you can view and manage your database records.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, ensure that you have followed all the steps correctly, especially setting up the .env file and installing dependencies.
Make sure that all the required packages are installed, and your Node.js version is compatible with the project.
Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run your T3 stack application locally.
