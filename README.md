README: How to Run the T3 Stack Application Locally
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

T3 Stack: Make sure you have the T3 stack installed. You can follow the installation guide on the T3 documentation.
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the Node.js official website.
npm: npm comes bundled with Node.js. You can verify the installation by running:
bash
Copy code
npm -v
SQLite: Ensure SQLite is installed on your system. You can download it from the SQLite official website.
Prisma CLI: Make sure Prisma CLI is installed. You can install it globally with the following command:
bash

npm install -g prisma

Steps to Run the App Locally

Clone the Repository
Open your terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username and your-repository with your GitHub username and the name of the repository.
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies by running:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up the Database

Create a .env file in the root directory if it doesn't already exist.
Add your database URL in the .env file. It should look like this:
env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
Run the following command to apply the migrations and set up the database:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma migrate dev
This command will create the necessary database tables and seed your database if you've set up any seed files.
Run the Development Server

After the database is set up, you can start the development server by running:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command will start the application, and you should see output indicating the server is running.
Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
You should see your application running.
Optional: Run Prisma Studio

To manage your database visually, you can run Prisma Studio by executing:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma studio
This will open a new tab in your browser where you can view and manage your database records.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, ensure that you have followed all the steps correctly, especially setting up the .env file and installing dependencies.
Make sure that all the required packages are installed, and your Node.js version is compatible with the project.
Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run your T3 stack application locally.
